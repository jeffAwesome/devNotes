Notes for today: Nov 17th 2014
Time: 8:46AM
  Ran into a strange issue with the forms not working on regonline.com.
  Doing debugging into the issue.

Time: 10:50AM
  It looks like this is only happening on the mobile side of things.
  There is a chance the form never worked on mobile. Getting several undefined
  issues.

Time: 11:35AM

  It looks like the problem is coming down to the ipjSubmitIronPointForm in the ip-utilities.js file.
  JsLint is giving me several issues here, but none that would cause the problem of the form not submitting,
  or at least I don't think so.

  Douglas Crockford is most likely mad at this 
    var i=eventArgument.indexOf('eval:');
    if(i>=0){
      eval(eventArgument.substring(i+5));
    }


Time: 2:35PM
  After quite some time of debugging. I don't think there is anything I can do. It looks like the
  problem on mobile is occuring based on an asp.net helper function. Its defined outside of anything we can edit.

  Also the error does occur on the desktop version but only when the form validation fails, it still seems to go through.
