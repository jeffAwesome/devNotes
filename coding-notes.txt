    Reverting the calendar back to the original, more traditional view.
    Changing the markup slightly. Getting a strange error when trying to loop through
    the events.
  1:56 pm
    Still no luck. Made some changes. Decided to look back in the commit changes.
    I found how the content was being rendered before. THis should fix the problem.

    Getting odd assets... the images keep deleting themselves in the public directory.
    No idea why... but looking into this.. but its stopping development

    So the images work but once you restart the app they're deleted... this is very strange.
    And i'm not sure what the problem is.. its something I will need to talk to jason
    or time about in the morning. if I can't solve it tonight.
