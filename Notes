  Working on a none js project what what!!
  I am working on getting the filter by tag working for different views.
  Right now when I click the event the click event fires... but the
  App.vent.trigger doesn't fire... or if it does its not finding where it needs
  to go..... need to solve this... asap



Time: 5:00pm
  I figured out how to get the views to register and change
  but I think instead of duplicating I am going to build a function
  that can be  called from any view... that function will do the heavy
  lifting... I just need to pass in the view and the filter... it will do
  the rest :) this will solve a lot of issues when making it a component/tool

  I am working on getting two way events between the muster worker list and the
  the tracked point representing that worker.

  So far I have a simple version of this working for the tracked point click.
  When you click on a tracked point you have access to that model instance data
  including worker id which we are using as the primary key. I get that model data then look
  for that user on the muster worker list. IT has a corresponding worker id that will be the same
  on both instances


  I ended up using a much more backbone way to make a muster worker selected. I created
  a default option called selected. When you click on the tracked point view it sets the worker
  to selected: true. This causes the view to re render which thens adds the selected class
  on the specific view

  I also unset it on the off click of the tracked point

  I am going to be working on the columnar functionality. This one is a big one.
  The plan:
    I need to prelaod 6 'columns' and allow the user to toggle left and right for more columns.

    It would work like this

    [][1,2,3,4][5] -> [1][2,3,4,5][6] -> [1,2][3,4,5,6][7]

    When you get to the end of either site we will making that link unclickable so you have to click the other
    side to get back to the beginning and vice versa... at the beginning you'll need to click the next, because
    the previous will be unclickable until there are items to that side.


    I'm thinking the best approach will be ajax possibly jquery load and load the needed items. I believe this will be a similar
    concept to what I used a few years ago with a slide show.

    Container was a certain width and overflow hidden so it hides the hidden elements. Pushing and pulling. THe only difference
    is I won't need to clone the first and last elements since it will stop when you've reached the top or bottom of the stack.

Oh yeah Rusty is 5 months old today :).

  whoa  I haven't been productive today in terms of taking notes.
  I am going to be working on the baton form updates now.



Notes for Today: Oct 8th 2013

MORE CACHING ISSUES:

This time it involves baton and changing the order of the form fields... If I leave them as is the tets pass but moving
the body field above the recipients causes it to fail. I need to check if moving other fields around cause the tests to fail.
I will do that now....
IF any of the fields are rearranged the tests fail.... WTF!!!$!!!@#@%#%*@#$@!!

I haven't found any resource on why moving around a field would cause this error
I've changed orders added the same field twice(caused lots of errors which isn't a bad thing).
I still have no idea why this simple thing would cause the issues

Time: 11:54am
  Could it possibly be due to caching? I am going to clear rails cache and see if that helps
  Well running Rails.cache.clear seems to have hung up the tests. Again why?!?? I have no idea.
  Its been well over a minute without a single movement from the tests with rails.cache.clear.
  IT FAILED!!!!! Moving On.


Time: 12:11pm
  Well I think I am onto something. If I check if a baton exists on the page..
  if there isn't one on the page we build one... is starting to help... but 2 out of three tests
  are still erroring out. I am going to see what I can do from here.

Time: 12:15pm
  Well it still doesn't work now all my tests are failing again. I'm not at all sure why. I am
  100% lost and i've tried everything I can think of. I will most likely bug the guys after lunch. THis
  is so frustrating to say the least. It works I've watched it work I've manually tested it.

  The other tests work fine even when changing positions of the form.

Time: 2:41pm
  And were back. I'm going to spend the remaining 55 minutes on this then moving to AoM.
  The best solution is to stop eating time on this for now. I'm just going to focus on functionality
  and come back to testing at the end. SHould work faster this way.

rake test TEST=/test


Time: 4:35pm
I think it had to do with a rebase and then conflict I ran into yesterday.... so that sucks 3 hours of being stuck on something
that was most likely a non issue.

I have got this working in a new branch with all tests passing.... and it took about an hour.


Time: 5:38pm
For whatever reason I lost the git commit with my code making the subject label match the selected baton label... so that's lame.
I updated the code to set it up working in the new baton form, but not the edit baton form
All the tests are passing though which is good. I am going to be moving onto Art of Manliness now.





Notes for today

Issues with the unread activities branch AGAAIN!!!! The resets unread activities
when visiting activities page is failing sporadically again! I'm not sure why..
I had tested 8 times with it passing and now its back to sporadic failing.

Now it passes 2-3 times and fails 2 times. Then repeates in that order.

I need to find out why and get it fixed to 100% passing 100% of the time.

###### Truncate recipients in sent & received #########
This needs to mimic facebook functionality on likes... after about 3 likes
it condenses to JOhn, Kate.. and 2 others like this.

The baton will say "To - JOhn, you, and 7 others" or something similar. There are
a few varying factors here... What happens if you are the baton assignee (the first
    person being sent a baton)? You must then display something like this....
"To - You, John and 7 others".  So we need to make sure we show the assignee( the first
    person being sent the baton) even if its "You" and then one other user again even if it
is or isn't you.

We then need to make the link clickable to show the rest of the assignees.. How will they
be displayed? A popover, a dropdown showing them like the hidden form elements?

This last portion I need to either create or add some prexisting javascript to acheive
whatever UX we go with here.

I will edit(?) the existing decorator for assigness for this area.


##### WRITE A BLOG POST about this DAMN TESTING/CACHING BUG #######
Seriously write a post about it... even if you haven't found a
solid answer for it write a blog post about it explaining the
problem and then boom go from there.... who cares if no one reads it
at least you're writing it and its making you describe the problem
in a different light.


##### IMPORTANT NOTE ############
I was getting a strange issue about tmp/cache not existing.. for
the travis builder

I found a link explaining why
https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-rails/issues/203

"If I didn't run rails server prior to running cucumber; and I want to clear a cache for every test
Rails.cache.clear
I end up with the following error:"
